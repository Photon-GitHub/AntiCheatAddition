#
# - Equipment-Hider: If a player is not visible to another player, ESP will hide any equipment they are wearing or have in their hands.

  # Here, you can define your own simple Sentinel checks.
  # Please ensure that you use NO SPECIAL CHARACTERS and NO DUPLICATE NAMES for the check name.
  # Special characters are permissible in channel names and “contains”.
  #
  # A basic guide for creating your own check:
  # (1) Copy the section of PXMod
  # (2) Rename the section from PXMod to <NAME_OF_YOUR_CUSTOM_CHECK>
  # (3) Add the channels you want to listen to in incoming channels (e.g. “minecraft:brand”).
  #     AntiCheatAddition automatically tries to generate the legacy channel names and listens to those as well
  #     (in this case, “MC|Brand”). If you know the legacy name, add it and AntiCheatAddition will choose the
  #     correct one for your server version.
  # (4) If needed, clarify what the message should include to trigger the check. E.g. if you are listening to
  #     “minecraft:brand” and superspecialmod:version to detect a mod you could define containsAny as: [“SSM”, “ssm”].
  #     Note: This is a purely fictional example. Mods have different channels and messages.
  #     Many do not communicate, especially cheat clients.
  # (5) Define the commands you want to execute when the mod is detected. The commands are executed exactly once right
  #     after player join. This allows you to e.g. disallow a certain mod on your server by kicking players on join.
